                Hello, I'm Elliot, and I am currently a student taking the Computer Programming/Analysis advanced diploma 
                at Conestoga College. I have been learning game development for the last 3 years or so, and after college, 
                I plan on pursuing a job in the game industry, however, I am also interested in 
                web, software and app development as well :)

                    I started working on this game over a year ago now, and I am proud of how far it is come. 
                    (Although I have really only worked on it for about 4 months)
                    I am hoping to put more time into working on this once in my free time 
                    and hopefully have it completed by the time I graduate...

                    I finished this as part of a school project that gave me a LOT of freedom and this was far beyond the scope of
                    what I was asked, but I was super passionate about it so I'm glad I went all in. It is still crazy going back
                    and playing it, because it is like a time capsule to what my life looked like 8 months ago.

                    Completing this project helped me vastly improve my 3d modeling capabilities by forcing me to make life-like models
                    without using references in Maya, but rather closely examining the objects in real life.

                    This game is still fairly early in development, but I decided to work on it with my friend of mine as 
                    I thought it would be good practice to work in a team rather than on my own. I think visually, it has a
                    long way to go, but it will only get better as I continue to flesh out the environment and polish the look. 
                    It also includes a fully functioning grand piano, which I spent way too long working on..

                    This project has really helped improve my C# skills as there are many interconnected systems that required a
                    little more programmatical finesse to implement well.
