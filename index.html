                Hello, I'm Elliot, and I am currently a student taking the Computer Programming/Analysis advanced diploma 
                at Conestoga College. I have been learning game development for the last 2 years or so, and after college, 
                I plan on pursuing a job in the game industry, however, I am also interested in 
                web, software and app development as well :)

                Although I have made plenty of other smaller projects, the following are
                the three projects I am the most proud of, and would like to highlight

                    I started working on this game close to a year ago now, and I am proud of how far it is come. 
                    (Although I have really only worked on it for about 4 months)
                    I am hoping to put more time into working on this once my semester is over 
                    and hopefully have it completed by the time I graduate...

                    I finished this as part of a school project that gave me a LOT of freedom and this was far beyond the scope of
                    what I was asked, but I was super passionate about it so I'm glad I went all in. It is still crazy going back
                    and playing it, because it is like a time capsule to what my life looked like 8 months ago.

                    This last one isn't game design related, but it was one of the final projects in my web development course in my first
                    semester and it was the first time that I ACTUALLY felt like I had built a website. Not just small pieces of one, but more
                    or less, a functioning site, other than a few small things.
